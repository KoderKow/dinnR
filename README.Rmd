Hello! Thank you for checking out the dinnR app! This app was made to simplify the dinner planning process. dinnR helps to create a weekly meal plan and generate a shopping list to show the ingredients needed for the week. If you would like to add a recipe to the app, you can make a submission [here](https://forms.gle/T5pHyzZrNhzDrEd37). Please be sure to include your information if you would like to be credited!

We do stream the making of this app over on our [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/theeatgamelove), so come say hello and let us know if you have any comments or ideas! Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/hrec3NP) and talk with us in the  #dinnr-suggestions channel as well. <3

## Dev Notes

Update the package dependencies with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
attachment::att_amend_desc(
  extra.suggests = c(
    "rlang",
    attachment::att_from_rscript("data-raw/dinn.R")
  )
)
```


## Thanks To ...
